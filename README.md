Current Version
I've built a Django web app that uses data scraped from Linkedin to display recent job posts. The data is scraped using a previous project that uses Selenium to login into LinkedIn and scrape jobs using a predefined URL. 

The project was undertaken to learn how to build Django apps, integrate them with a Postgres database, and to brush up on CSS and HTML. 

Version 2
- In the coming weeks, I plan to add account creation and user authentication. 
- Users will be able to log in to an account, see recent jobs, and add them to a MyJobs section which will display two sectionsâ€” "Saved" and "Applied for"
- I will add Javascript to make the webpage more interactive, so I can brush up on Javascript skills. 
- I also plan to analyze my data and add a visualization app/section that allows users to see the breakdown of jobs based on keywords. For example, seeing how many jobs use words such as "python", "java", "javascript", "full stack", "backend", "frontend" etc. This will help me get more of a hold on python libraries such as Pandas, Seaborn, and NumPy.
